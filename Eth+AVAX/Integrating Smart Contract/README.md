# Integrating Smart Contract
  

## Description

Create a simple contract with 2-3 functions. Then show the values of those functions in frontend of the application.

### Getting Started
Ethers.js
The ethers.js library is a compact library for interacting with the Ethereum Blockchain and its ecosystem.
It was originally designed for use with ethers.io and has since expanded into a more general-purpose library.

Application flow
Firstly, connect your wallet by clicking on connect wallet button.
Your balance will be updated automatically after each transaction.
You can deposit the balance into your account by clicking the deposit button.
You can withdraw funds using Withdraw button.

### Executing program
```
Create a hardhat project and add your smart contract to it 
Add the front end files
```
OR
```
After cloning the github, you will want to do the following to get the code running on your computer.

1. Inside the project directory, in the terminal type: npm i
2. Open two additional terminals in your VS code
3. In the second terminal type: npx hardhat node
4. In the third terminal, type: npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
5. Back in the first terminal, type npm run dev to launch the front-end.
```

After this, the project will be running on your localhost. 
Typically at http://localhost:3000/
